# The purpose of the poker bot scripts
In the **near future** we will be adding working examples of bots that you can pick up and run. The intention is to give a full working set of bots that users can then use as a starting block to build upon.

The focus of the bots will be on the following criterias:

- Accessing game play
- Posting blinds
- Sitting in and out
- Checking
- Folding
- Raising
- ReRaising
- Playing tight
- Playing aggressive
- Playing loose
- Varying plays according to players re/actions
- Analyzing users you are playing against for patterns and countering that
